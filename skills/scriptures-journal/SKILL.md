Generate thoughtful journaling prompts based on a scripture passage.

## When to Use

Use when the user wants to:
- Journal about their scripture study

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get the scripture

Use `mcp__scriptures__lookup_verse` or `mcp__scriptures__lookup_chapter` to get the text.

### Step 2: Identify journaling angles

Find opportunities for:
- Personal connection (How does this relate to my life?)
- Gratitude (What am I thankful for because of this?)
- Commitment (What will I do differently?)
- Questions (What do I want to understand better?)
- Testimony (What do I know to be true?)

### Step 3: Generate prompts

Create 5-7 journaling prompts that:
- Start with specific phrases from the scripture
- Invite personal reflection
- Encourage specific examples
- Build on each other progressively
